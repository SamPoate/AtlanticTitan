Atlantic Titan is made up of just me, Rob Hamilton. I’m 28 and from the quiet, leafy town of Haslemere in Surrey although I spend much of my time living in Windsor. Despite (or perhaps because of) my comfortable, thoroughly middle class surroundings, I have always had a love for the ocean, travel and endurance events. I am an experienced scuba diver having passed my PADI scuba dive instructor course at 18 and going on to complete a number of technical diving qualifications. My curiosity about the world and how far I can push myself led me to complete a master’s in Near and Middle Eastern Studies at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, travel to nearly 50 countries and complete two ultra-mountain marathons.
                <br />
                <br />
In 2016, I achieved a lifelong ambition when I was accepted into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst for training to become an Army officer. Soon after I started, however, I injured my knee (by literally killing off part of my femur), was permanently medically discharged from the Army and put on crutches for three months with a further three months of no sport. I went from someone who could run 50 miles over mountains, to someone who could walk around town for 20 minutes before having to call it a day. This race is a chance to prove to myself and demonstrate to others that life changing events and injuries do not have to permanently change your way of life. With a little grit and determination, incredible things are possible!
                <br />
                <br />
The Atlantic row also presents a tremendous opportunity to raise money for an organisation which I have a very close relationship with. In 2018, I spent several months working for the Collateral Repair Project (CRP) in Amman, Jordan. The organisation helps refugees through emergency aid and community programmes such as English classes, after-school clubs and psycho-social support. I am hoping to raise at least £50,000 for this amazing organisation. The name, Atlantic Titan, was the idea of a friend who is a beneficiary of the organisation.

          <div class="content-h-split">
            <p>
              The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is often touted as one of
              the world’s toughest race, and with good reason. The annual race
              starts ever December in the Canary Islands and finishes 3000 miles
              later, in Antigua. During the race I will have to contend with
              seasickness, salt sores, sleep deprivation, dehydration, extreme
              heat, isolation, 30ft high waves, 35 degree heat, sharks, and
              possible capsizes. Despite eating over 6000 calories a day, I will
              likely lose at least 12kg by the time I finish in Antigua. It is
              perhaps unsurprising that more people have climbed Everest than
              successfully rowed across an ocean.
              <br />
              <br />
              While there are two safety yachts for the fleet in case of
              emergencies, the race itself is unsupported. I will carry
              everything I need to cross the Atlantic in my boat, this includes
              enough food for 90 days, a water maker to purify sea water, a
              satellite phone, life raft, radio and chart plotter.
              <br />
              <br />
              December 2020 may seem a long way off, however, there is a huge
              amount of training and preparation to do. To assist with my
              preparations, I am actively seeking sponsorship to help achieve my
              incredible goal. Please download a sponsorship document if you
              would like more information on my challenge can support your
              organisation.

              I am hoping to raise at least £50,000 for Collateral Repair
              Project (CRP), a refugee support organisation based in Amman,
              Jordan. The organisation is apolitical and areligious meaning they
              support refugees from a wide spectrum of nationalities and faiths.
              programmes
              <br />
              <br />
              When most people think about the refugee crisis, they think of
              boats making dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean, and
              families crowded into tents in European camps. But the reality is
              that the vast majority of displaced people never reach Europe.
              This is where CRP comes in. Since 2006, CRP have supported urban
              refugees in Amman. The organisation tries to meet the immediate
              needs of its beneficiaries by distributing food vouchers and
              providing medical support. They give out warm clothes and heaters
              in the winter, and back-to-school supplies in September. At their
              community centre in east Amman they offer classes and activities
              focusing on education and trauma relief. There are sports trips,
              art and calligraphy classes, and Arabic literacy classes for kids.
              They have trauma sensitive yoga sessions, a barbershop and beauty
              school livelihood programmes. They help their beneficiaries
              recover from the past and equip them for the future. The community
              centre is a safe, non-sectarian space, where they welcome people
              of all different religions and nationalities, promoting social
              cohesion.
              <br />
              <br />
              The organisation has a special meaning to me as I spent several
              months working for CRP in 2018. I therefore know about the life
              changing work they do and can safely say that your donations will
              make a real difference to the lives of refugees. I may have
              experienced injuries and setbacks, but the beneficiaries of CRP
              have had their homes taken away and were forced to flee to another
              country. CRP supports them as they start a new chapter in their
              lives.
