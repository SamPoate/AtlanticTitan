                                29-year-old Rob Hamilton. Rob has always enjoyed
                                pushing himself to find his limit. He has
                                completed two ultra-mountain marathons, is a
                                climber, a technical diver, a powerlifter and
                                has travelled to 48 countries so far, with a
                                particular fascination for the Middle East.

                                In 2016 Rob achieved a lifelong dream when he
                                started his training to become an officer in the
                                British Army at the Royal Military Academy
                                Sandhurst. However, shortly after starting his
                                training he injured his knee and was medically
                                discharged. The diagnosis – avascular necrosis
                                resulting in a partially dead knee, three months
                                on crutches and no more long-distance running.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                            </p>

                                This was certainly a shock to his system and
                                while he had always wanted to take part in the
                                Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, this
                                unfortunate turn of events meant he is now more
                                determined than ever to not only complete the
                                crossing but win the solo category. With the
                                goal of proving to himself and others that
                                injuries and life changing events need not be a
                                barrier for achieving extraordinary things.

                            You would be hard pressed to find a better way of
                            achieving this than to row across the Atlantic. The
                            Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is often touted
                            as the world’s toughest race and the premier event
                            in ocean rowing, and with good reason. The 3000-mile
                            race starts every December in La Gomera, the Canary
                            Islands and finishes up to three months later in
                            Antigua. Rob will be totally unsupported, carrying
                            everything he needs for the crossing on his boat and
                            won’t leave his boat until he reaches Antigua.

                            <strong>Sleep Deprivation</strong> – Rowing for up
                            to 18 hours a day is exhausting, giving very little
                            time to sleep, coupled with the fact that sleeping
                            in an ocean rowing boat is often quite bumpy. Ocean
                            rowers frequently report hallucinations.

                            <strong>Salt Sores</strong> – Salt from the ocean
                            gets everywhere, all over your skin and clothes.
                            With nowhere to wash the salt can often lead to
                            painful sores which have the potential to lead to
                            infection.

                            <strong>Dehydration</strong> – With temperatures in
                            excess of 30 degrees, no shade on the boat and
                            rowing all day, every day, dehydration is a real
                            risk. The onboard watermaker is therefore a vital
                            piece of equipment.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Waves</strong> – Waves in the Atlantic can
                            be big, really big, up to 30ft (9 metres) high, in
                            fact. This may be ok in a larger ocean-going vessel
                            but in a small 24ft (7.3 metres) rowing boat it can
                            lead to capsizes.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <strong>Food</strong> – Spending all this time
                            rowing burns a huge number of calories,
                            approximately 8000 a day. However, rowers typically
                            only manage to eat 6000 calories a day. Therefore,
                            Rob will likely lose between 10kg and 15kg on the
                            crossing. This may be exacerbated by bouts of sea
                            sickness which drain energy and motivation making it
                            all that much harder.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Overall, the mental challenge of rowing across an
                            ocean outweighs the physical. There are times during
                            the race where the water will be 5km deep and you
                            will be closer to someone in space than on land.
                            Indeed, more people have been into space than have
                            rowed across an ocean, let alone completed a solo
                            crossing.

                            to be an officer in the British Army has given him
                            an appreciation of the needs of both refugees and

                            Rob’s campaign aims to draw support for what is
                            essentially two sides of the same coin. Rob is
                            hoping to raise £50,000 for these two charities with
                            all contributions split evenly between them.

                            When most people think about the refugee crisis,
                            they think of boats making dangerous journeys across
                            the Mediterranean, and families crowded into tents
                            in European camps. But the reality is that the vast
                            majority of displaced people never reach Europe.
                            This is where CRP comes in. Since 2006, CRP have
                            supported urban refugees in Amman. The organisation
                            tries to meet the immediate needs of its
                            beneficiaries by distributing food vouchers and
                            providing medical support. They give out warm
                            clothes and heaters in the winter, and
                            back-to-school supplies in September. At their
                            community centre in east Amman they offer classes
                            and activities focusing on education and trauma
                            relief.

                            On a trip to the Warrior Games in the USA in 2013,
                            HRH The Duke of Sussex saw first-hand how the power
                            of sport can help physically, psychologically and
                            socially those suffering from injuries and illness.
                            He was inspired by his visit and the Invictus Games
                            was born. The Games have been supporting wounded
                            service personnel since 2014, when the inaugural
                            Invictus Games were held in London. The organisation
                            harness’ the power of sport to inspire recovery,
                            support rehabilitation and generate a wider
                            understanding and respect for those who serve their
                            country.
